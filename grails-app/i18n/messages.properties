##################OUR STORY
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.title=Ticbox | Our Story
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.title=Market Research?
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph1=Most people at some point in their lives have dreamed of becoming entrepreneurs.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph2=Many friends of mine have their own "million-dollar-idea", but they never can be sure that the concept is viable until they execute it. To try the idea, they have to raise funds, use all their savings, quit their jobs, etc., which can lead to success but more often leads to a complete failure.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph3=Asking friends and family their opinions is the most common first (and often only) step that bootstrap entrepreneurs take. Unfortunately, it's not a very good platform to use to make major business decisions. Here's why: first off, friends and family members may not represent the target audience the idea is designed for.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph4=Second, 'friends and family' is a very limited network that can't represent a neutral nationwide opinion. Finally, these people may not be honest in their feedback in an effort to be encouraging or at least not offensive.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph5=Therefore, many potentially great ideas never get off the ground just because traditional market research services are financially out of reach and home-made alternatives are just not reliable.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph6=I had a similar problem with the app that i was building 2 years ago. I spent quite some time developing awesome functionality and driving users to the app, putting a great deal of money and effort into tons of cool innovative features, and yet it didn't take off as i had expected.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.marketresearch.paragraph7=Our endless "to do or not to do" discussions were mostly intuition and logic driven, but often ended up being very far from actual users demand. I was quite frustrated and wished there was a simple and affordable way to ask potential users what they would appreciate the most in the app before i ever started development and spent any time on it. I looked around and was amazed that there was no tool out there affordable enough that i could use.

ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.title=Why Ticbox?
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.paragraph1=Ticbox is an online 'do-it-yourself' market research with integrated respondents. We also create mobile applications, which can simplify, the respondents to do the survey and put gamification layer that will generate certain points.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.paragraph2=There are two ways to use Ticbox, first it is the Free Way and second is the Easy Way. If the surveyors choose the free option, they can create the survey and spread it to their own respondents based on their needs. But, if the surveyors want to choose the easy option, they can create the survey without to have the respondents first, because Ticbox provides the respondents for them based on their need. We also already have the character of the respondents, which will make it easier to filter the respondent for the survey that surveyor desire.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.paragraph3=Ticbox respondents will be the main focus. To create a result that has the reliability for every survey, Ticbox using Double Check algorithm and Trait/Trust Analytic. Ticbox also have reward and point for their respondent to maintain their loyalty. The mobile web version will make the respondents easier to fill the survey. They can install the application into their smartphone and do the survey there.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.paragraph4=Our vision is to make market research is more reachable and reliable for everyone in Indonesia.
ticbox.knowus.ourstory.whyticbox.paragraph5=Ticbox is Indonesian Company that lives in Indonesia, so we know more about local culture, condition, and behavior of Indonesian people. We provide panelists from Indonesia. And our Double Check and Trait/Trust analytic algorithm will ensure the respondent is reliable. We also know that people in Indonesia mostly access the internet through mobile so we will build our platform to become mobile friendly and push technology that will boost the market research delivery channel even more faster than before.
